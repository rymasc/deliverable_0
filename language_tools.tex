Several tools have been implemented at a programming language level in order to gain further insight from the developer about the application.
Things such as tasks, priority and dependencies need to be worked out for the system to function properly.
Many of these tools use a checkpointing system to check if energy will be available available before a task begins.
Eon was one of the first coordination based programming languages to add the concept of energy states on top of C \cite{eon}.
This allowed the programmer to assign flows and set energy states for various tasks.
Mementos \cite{mementos} adds energy checks at compile time and checkpointing and recovery occur at run time by itself because it is difficult to predict changing energy harvesting conditions.
Chain \cite{chain} ditches the checkpointing model in favor of a task based model to eliminate the overhead of checkpointing.
