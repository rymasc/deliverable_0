Much work has been done with the aim of lowering the barrier of entry to designing and implementing batteryless devices.
However, it still requires a significant amount of hardware knowledge to program a batteryless device.
Flicker and MayFly lay much of the ground work.
Flicker as stated previously allows the developer to dynamically change the charging level of peripherals, but leaves the challenge of how and when to do that to the developer.
MayFly adds the ability to
