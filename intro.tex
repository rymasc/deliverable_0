The vision of the Internet of Things still hasn't come to fruition.
Batteries are one of the largest obstacles to the Internet of Things \cite{intermittentAndAwesome}
These batteries can be removed and power can instead be harvested from the environment.
However, designing and implementing a batteryless device is not trivial.
Three major challenges associated with implementing a batteryless devices are intermittent power loss, time-keeping and the ever changing energy harvesting environment.
The main

Techniques such as Ekho \cite{ekho} can be used to measure the energy currently being harvested.
